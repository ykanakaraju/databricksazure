  
  Lab 12 - Vacuum the Delta table
  -------------------------------
	You can remove files no longer referenced by a Delta table and are older 
	than the retention threshold by running the 'vacuum' command on the table.
  
  
 1. Create a single node 'All-purpose compute' cluster.
 
 2. Import the notebook provided for this lab.
 
		Notebooks to import:
		* Delta-using-DataFrames-1.dbc
		* Delta-using-DataFrames-6.dbc
 
 
 3. Open the notebook 'Delta-using-DataFrames-6.dbc' and run the cells.
    Examine the results to understand how vacuum works on Delta tables.
	
		In this notebook, we demonstrate the following:
			
		* Examine the history of Delta table
		* Perform 'vacuum' on delta table
